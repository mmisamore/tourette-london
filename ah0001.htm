<p><i>The following article appeared in the TSFC London Chapter’s newsletter for May 2008.</i></p> <p><font face="Comic Sans MS, cursive"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Rage and Aggression in Children with TS</p> <h1>by Ray Robertson</h1> <p>Parents of children with TS who experience rages know that a “tourette rage” is somehow different from other forms of anger. Common features of a tourette rage are:</p> <ul> <li style="list-style: none"> <p>Onset is abrupt. The rage doesn’t build gradually; it explodes from nothing to full blast in a matter of seconds.</p> </li> <li style="list-style: none"> <p>End-stage is also abrupt. When the rage is over the child returns to normal very quickly. The rage is over as abruptly as it began. One moment the rage is full blast, the next moment it is gone, unlike normal anger or rage which takes time to wind down.</p> </li> <li style="list-style: none"> <p>There is no logical reason for the rage although triggers can often be identified.</p> </li> <li style="list-style: none"> <p>The anger may appear to be directed at the parent without reason.</p> </li> <li style="list-style: none"> <p>Some children, who are able to talk about the rage afterward, say there was no reason, can describe a minor event that acted as a trigger and will confirm that it was not directed at the parent.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Rage is not identified as a symptom of Tourette’s syndrome. The most widely accepted definition of TS comes from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) which is an <u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">American</a></u>handbook for <u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health_professionals">mental health professionals</a></u>published by the <u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Psychiatric_Association">American Psychiatric Association</a></u>that lists different categories of <u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder">mental disorders</a></u> and the criteria for diagnosing them. Rage is not included in their definition of TS.</p> <p>Identified disorders such as ADD, ADHD, OCD, anxiety, Autism and depression, when occurring in a child who has been diagnosed with Tourette’s syndrome, are acknowledged as co-morbid disorders. Rage, not having been identified as a disorder, doesn’t rate official co-morbid status.</p> <p>Parents of children with TS do, however, recognize this unique rage as being associated with their child’s TS.</p> <p>The aspect of the rage that most concerns parents is the behaviour associated with the rage. These behaviours are sometimes referred to as “extreme behaviours.” Different behaviours call for different coping techniques.</p> <p>The most extreme behaviour is one where it appears that the child may harm themselves or others. In such a case it is perfectly acceptable to call for help. Police officers are trained at restraining individuals who are acting physically violent. It may seem like an extreme response to call on the police to help restrain your child, however, the result of not calling for help could be worse.</p> <p><u><b>Dealing with Extreme Behaviours.</b></u></p> <p><u>Avoidance</u></p> <p>The first line of defense is prevention. If you can prevent an explosion from taking place you have won a battle before it starts. Most rages have one or more pre-conditions – a place, a time, certain people present, temperature, light, sound, stress, activity, setting, mood, food or tastes, sensory sensations – and more.</p> <p>One young girl couldn’t cope with having to make random hand movements such as scrunching paper. Any such demand would trigger a rage. Most of us succeed in scrunching paper the first time we try. For someone who cannot scrunch paper, there are no instructions. They were never written because it was always assumed that everyone would be capable of scrunching paper. This girl also had a problem with brushing her teeth and showering. Both these tasks required random movements. Scrunching paper could be avoided but brushing teeth and taking showers could not. Creating a step-by-step procedure for brushing teeth and showering put an end to those rages.</p> <p>Another child, a young boy, goes into a rage when he is trying to complete a task perfectly but is under a time constraint. His parents have learned to identify when these two events are likely to occur together.</p> <p>In both these cases parents have identified conditions that trigger the rage and have been able to take steps to avoid the conditions.</p> <p>Parents can identify these pre-conditions by simply keeping a mental note of what their child is doing. When a rage occurs make notes. Keep a log of what the child was doing in the hour or half-hour or ten minutes before the rage began. Look for conditions that re-occur.</p> <p>When you have identified something that triggers your child’s rage, make plans to avoid that condition or look for ways that the condition can be modified to avoid the rage.</p> <p><u>Acceptance:</u></p> <p>For most parents, the first time their child shows “extreme behaviour” they are shocked. Their child is using words they thought he wouldn’t even hear for at least five more years. The child is describing sexual and criminal behaviour they hoped he wouldn’t even know about until he was at least 25 years old.</p> <p>At this time, parents need to make a fast adjustment to their expectations. They need to quickly catch up to where their child is. Once having accepted that this behaviour really is happening and that it is not going to go away by itself, parents can begin to look at coping strategies.</p> <p><u>Medication:</u></p> <p>Medications are available that can help alleviate the symptoms, whether they be rage, aggression or extreme behaviour. Dr. Rob Nicolson, a psychiatrist who works with children who have TS at the Children’s Hospital of Western Ontario and at the Child and Parent Resource Institute’s Brake Shop for kids with TS, talks about medications that he prescribes for these conditions in his lectures at the Brake Shop’s “101” series.</p> <p>Even if parents are reluctant to give their child medications, they should at least talk to their treating physician so that they are aware of all the options.</p> <p><u>Emergency Department Treatment:</u></p> <p>The Tourette Syndrome Foundation of Canada strongly recommends that if you have any indication that your child or any other person you are responsible for, may be, in any way, considering suicide or any other action that could be harmful to themselves, they seek immediate medical advice, which, if necessary, means going to the nearest hospital emergency facility.</p> <p>Many parents use their nearest hospital emergency services when their child’s symptoms suddenly escalate or symptoms or behaviours occur that they are unfamiliar with and that they fear may result in some permanent damage. In most instances, the escalation of symptoms turns out to be part of the normal progression of the disorder and parents learn to cope with this newest set of conditions.</p> <p>However, the possibility exists that the condition the parents are seeing does, indeed, require emergency treatment and the only way to be safe is to have a professional make an assessment.</p> <p><u>Safe Rage</u></p> <p>Once a rage has begun, you as the parent have very little power to stop or redirect the rage.</p> <p>What you can do is minimize the damage.</p> <p>Remove other children from the area where the rage is occurring. Discuss with siblings what they should do or where they should go when they see a rage situation developing. If there is a child who is not capable of seeing the situation develop, work out a system of signals for that child. Or if necessary, physically move that child to a safer location.</p> <p>If there is ever an indication that the child wants to cut or stab while in the rage, make sure that all knives, scissors or other cutting devices in the home are stored where the child having the rage cannot access them. Use locks and keys if necessary.</p> <p>Other actions may include hitting things, throwing things and using objects to hit with. Once identified, remove these objects from the home or store them in a locked environment. Do what you can to minimize the damage. Things that you can’t secure, such as walls, floors and doors, can be repaired or replaced.</p> <p><u>Redirect the Actions</u></p> <p>The child can learn to re-direct the actions of the rage.</p> <p>You can’t negotiate with the child while the rage is going on.</p> <p>After the rage is over, you can talk with the child about the situation. The first condition on the parent’s part is to listen. Let the child tell you about what happened. Talk about the alternatives the child has. Ask about what the child sees as alternatives.</p> <p>Traditional alternatives have included taking out aggression on punching bags.</p> <p>Surprisingly, some kids with TS have reported that tearing up cardboard helps to calm their rage. If this can work for your child, save all your cardboard, store it where your child can get it if it will help.</p> <p><u>Live With It</u></p> <p>Some of the responses we describe will seem extreme, but extreme conditions require extreme actions.</p> <p>Parents who are dealing with behaviour that is a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10 don’t have the time or energy to deal with a behaviour that is a 2.</p> <p>Some experts have described this as “pick your battles.” If the situation is leading toward physical harm it is not the time to deal with the child using a bad word.</p> <p><u>Medical doctor</u></p> <p>Talk with your doctor. Describe the situation. Take your notes with you. Ask for help. Don’t wait for the next scheduled appointment. Call and make an appointment as soon as they will allow.</p> <p><u>Call for Help</u></p> <p>If your child, or anyone else, is behaving in a manner that is threatening the safety of themselves or other people or threatening damage to property, that you aren’t sure you can resolve, call for help.</p> <p>Police officers are trained to deal with extreme behaviour. They may not know about Tourette Syndrome, but they will be able to provide the help that is needed to physically restrain your child from causing damage.</p> <p>Calling the police “on your child” may seem like betrayal, but keep in mind that your child is not committing a criminal offence, you are only asking for assistance.</p> <p>James is a 32 year old man who was diagnosed with Tourette’s syndrome when he was 12 years old. James’ tics were always minor, his rage and aggression were the major issues his parents had to deal with. James’s parents, while learning to live and cope with his aggressive and destructive behaviour, were eventually able to find facilitation for their son, in a non-profit organization that draws on government funds and provides housing and round-the-clock supervision.</p> <p>For the past 6 years James has been “working” at a neighbourhood business office, accompanied by his care worker, performing tasks that are within his ability range.</p> <p>Recently, a change was introduced to James’ normal daily routine without the appropriate steps being taken to introduce the change. James became aggressive and eventually, 8 police officers were involved in resolving the situation.</p> <p>In James’ case, help was needed and those involved didn’t hesitate to call for help.</p> <p><u>Self-help Groups.</u></p> <p>The simplest definition of self-help is “people helping people.” Other definitions of self-help include phrases like “the need to talk, hearing other’s stories, learning from others and sharing a common problem.”</p> <p>Whatever the definition, self-help groups provide a setting for people to talk with other people who share a common problem. Sharing your stories about your child’s rage and hearing other parents tell their stories can provide helpful information on how to deal with rages.</p> <p>The London Chapter of the Tourette Syndrome Foundation of Canada hosts regular self-help meetings for parents of children with TS. Outside the London area, you can call the national office of the TSFC for locations where self-help meetings are held.</p> <p><u>Look at the Disorders:</u></p> <p>The associated disorders listed above such as – OCD, ADD, ADHD, etc – as well as TS itself, can be a source of frustration to a child that can lead to anger.</p> <p>First, make sure you have the correct diagnosis for your child. An accurate definition is needed in order to get the proper treatment. Directing treatment at a child’s TS when OCD is the more problematic may not be a good use of resources.</p> <p>Second, look for treatments that are specifically for the condition that has been diagnosed.</p> <p>Emily showed symptoms of TS when she was 7 years old. At the age of 13 she was diagnosed with TS and OCD. At that time Emily was having rages on a daily basis.</p> <p>Emily took part in a program that taught her to deal with some of her obsessions. As a result of what she learned in the program Emily’s rages totally disappeared.</p> <p>Not everyone will resolve rages as in Emily’s case but knowing your child’s condition will help you decide on proper treatment.</p> <p>Habit-reversal Training (HRT) for TS and Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) for OCD are just 2 non-medical treatments available.</p> <p>HRT has recently been shown to benefit people with TS. A new study, to be published soon, shows solid evidence that HRT can give relief from tics. Many studies have been done on ERP and the consensus is that people with OCD can benefit from this treatment.</p> <p>Other programs and treatments are available for other associated disorders. Take some time to investigate what might work for your child. Talk with your doctor about programs available. Talk with the people at your child’s school – they may offer a program or know where programs are available.</p> <p><u>Reading Material:</u></p> <p>The book “Tourette Syndrome: Finding Answers &amp; Getting Help” by Mitzi Waltz includes a chapter about rages.</p> <p>Dr. Ross Greene’s book, “The Explosive Child,” is an excellent resource for parents who have children with extreme behaviours.</p> <p>The Brake Shop at London’s Child and Parent Resource Institute has made available a series of articles dealing with TS. The article titled Putting the Brakes on Rage is an excellent source of information for dealing with rages.</p>
