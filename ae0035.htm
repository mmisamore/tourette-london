<h1>Diagnosis</h1> <table width="677" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0"> <col width="659"> <tr> <td width="659" height="324" valign="top" style="border: 1px solid #000000; padding: 0in 0.08in"> <p><a href="ae0001.htm">Tourette Syndrome</a> is a neurological or “neuro-chemical” disorder characterized by <a href="ae0004.htm">tics</a> - involuntary, rapid, sudden <a href="ae0062.htm">movements</a> or <a href="ae0063.htm">vocalizations</a> that occur repeatedly at irregular intervals. The current criteria for diagnosis (developed mainly for scientific and research purposes) are as follows:</p> <p>1. Both multiple motor and one or more vocal <a href="ae0004.htm">tics</a> present at some time during the disorder although not necessarily simultaneously,</p> <p>2. The occurrence of <a href="ae0004.htm">tics</a> many times a day (usually in bouts) nearly every day or intermittently throughout a span of more than 1 year,</p> <p>3. The periodic change in the number, frequency, type and location of the <a href="ae0004.htm">tics</a> and in the waxing and waning of their severity. Symptoms can even disappear for weeks or months at a time, and</p> <p>4. Onset before the age of 21.</p> </td> </tr> </table> <p>This criteria is taken from the <a href="ae0024.htm">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual</a> (<a href="ae0024.htm">DSM</a>) of the American Psychiatric Association. Changes to this criteria have taken place in the past and will likely take place in the future.</p> <p>The term “<a href="ae0011.htm">involuntary</a>” used to describe <a href="ae0001.htm">TS</a> tics is a source of confusion since it is known that most individuals with <a href="ae0001.htm">TS</a> do have some control over their <a href="ae0018.htm">symptoms</a>. What is not recognized is that the control, which can be exerted from seconds to hours at a time, may merely postpone more severe outbursts of <a href="ae0018.htm">symptoms</a>. Some <a href="ae0004.htm">tics</a> are experienced as an irresistible urge and must eventually be expressed. Individuals with <a href="ae0001.htm">TS</a> often seek a secluded or safe place to release their <a href="ae0018.htm">symptoms</a> after delaying them in school or at work. Thus, they may be at their worst at home. Typically, <a href="ae0004.htm">tics</a> increase as a result of tension or stress (but are not caused by stress) and decrease with concentration on an absorbing task.</p> <p>Some diagnosing professionals will strictly adhere to the <a href="ae0024.htm">DSM</a> criteria while others will allow for some variance in the symptoms.</p> <p>In one reported case a 29 year old woman suddenly began displaying classic <a href="ae0018.htm">symptoms</a> of <a href="ae0001.htm">TS</a> where no <a href="ae0018.htm">symptoms</a> had previously been evident. During discussions with her mother, the woman recalled having had <a href="ae0001.htm">TS</a>-like or <a href="ae0004.htm">tic</a>-like behaviours when she was a teen. In this case, the history allows the <a href="ae0024.htm">DSM</a> criteria to be met, however, had the mother not been available, the criteria would not have been met.</p> <p>In a 2007 presentation at the <a href="ae0031.htm">TSFC</a>’s annual conference a speaker presented the case that <a href="ae0063.htm">sounds</a>, either vocal or phonic, were created by muscle movements and therefore all <a href="ae0004.htm">tics</a> should be considered “motor.”</p>
