<p><i>The following article appeared in the TSFC London Chapter’s newsletter for February 2008.</i></p> <p><font face="Comic Sans MS, cursive"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt"><b>To Count or Not to Count</b> <font face="Comic Sans MS, cursive"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">(<font face="Comic Sans MS, cursive"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt"><b>Or</b> <font face="Comic Sans MS, cursive"><font size="3" style="font-size: 13pt">to not count)</p> <p><font face="Comic Sans MS, cursive"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><i>by Ray Robertson</i></p> <p>Counting and being obsessed with numbers is part of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Many people with TS, even though not diagnosed with OCD, have, at the least, a tiny corner of their being that likes numbers or likes to count things.</p> <p>I was recently accused of being a “counter.” I was watching a cycle race in Springbank Park on a Sunday afternoon with family and friends and I was keeping track of the number of riders in the lead pack of a 42 km race. That didn’t seem obsessive to me – I just wanted to know if someone from the second pack had moved up or if someone from the first pack had dropped back. Seemed reasonable.</p> <p>Later there was a gaggle of Canada geese in the park. Six adults and 34 goslings. I wanted to know how many young ones there were to a family. There would be five to six if all the adults were mothers – more if any of the adults were fathers. Seemed reasonable.</p> <p>To anyone outside my family this was obsessive counting.</p> <p>So what is obsessive counting or an obsession with numbers?</p> <p>I know a mother of a child with TS who has only 1 obsession and that obsession is with numbers. When she sets the alarm on her digital clock the numbers must add to 9. To get up at 7:30 she sets the alarm for 7:29 – 7 + 2 + 9 = 18 and 1 + 8 = 9. To get up at 8:00 she sets the alarm for 8:01 – 8 + 0 + 1 = 9. To get up at 7:00 she sets the alarm for 7:02 – 7 + 0 + 2 = 9. You get the picture.</p> <p>Obsessions with counting and numbers can be as debilitating to an individual as tics and rages.</p> <p>Dr. Mort Doran, a surgeon living in Cranbrook, BC has had TS since he was a child but wasn’t diagnosed until he was an adult and had finished medical school. Dr. Doran has talked publicly about his TS at conferences and information sessions, including one in London in 1996. A story he has repeated over the years tells about his obsession with numbers.</p> <p>Dr. Doran is a licensed pilot and owns his own small aircraft. He is married, with two sons, and on Sunday afternoons they will occasionally take a ride in the air. They leave home in two cars. After the flight, his wife and sons will drive home from the air field in one car, leaving Mort to secure the plane. At this point the obsessions begin. The plane has to be tied down and the ties have to be checked and counted again and again. These counting and checking rituals can take more than an hour.</p> <p>In a March 1995 interview, written by Oliver Sacks, Dr. Doran talks about numbers. “It is similar with the number compulsions,” he said, “now I have to do everything by threes or fives, but until a few months ago it was fours and sevens. Then one morning I woke up – four and seven had gone, but three and five had appeared instead. It’s as if one circuit were turned on upstairs, and another turned off. It doesn’t seem to have anything to do with me.”</p> <p>Most number obsessions are with odd numbers – threes, fives, sevens and nines. Dr. Doran’s mention of the number four is unusual. Having to perform a task back and forth, such as switching a light off and being obsessed with the number 5 – off, on, off, on, off – leaves the light in the off position, whereas being obsessed with the number 4 would leave the light on, which wasn’t where we wanted it to be.</p> <p>Counting can be combined with evening-up or with a symmetry ritual where, for example, counting to 5 can be done as 1-2-3-2-1.</p> <p>To outsiders, people who aren’t familiar with obsessions, this sounds like nonsense, silliness and trivia. Or maybe even laziness, - can’t get out of bed until the clock’s numbers are just right. Or maybe numerophobia – fear of one of the ten numbers.</p> <p>Obsessions with counting and numbers don’t often take over someone’s life but they can, at times, be very distracting.</p> <p>Consider an obsession with the number of wheels on tractor-trailer rigs on the highway. Counting wheels on a vehicle going in the opposite direction while traveling at 110 k/ph could even be considered dangerous. However, knowing at a glance, by memory, that a double tanker carrying gasoline has 30 wheels and a typical Toronto garbage truck has 34 wheels eliminates a lot of actual counting. Coming across a rig with over 100 wheels, carrying a 100 foot long, 10 foot high “I” beam on the 401, with light-flashing DOT and police vehicles escorting, is the experience of a lifetime for a tractor-trailer-wheel-counter.</p> <p>In some cases the satisfaction is in the counting – not the number arrived at. One person tells of working in an office tower where he often needed to make trips to another floor during the day. Each time he went up or down the stairs, between floors, he counted the number of steps. Before counting there was never any recollection of the number of steps from a previous count and even today he can’t remember the number of steps there were between floors. For him it was the act of counting that was the obsession, not the result.</p> <p>So, enjoy counting, enjoy the numbers, just don’t become obsessed with them.</p> <p>Wait - obsessed is what it’s all about. Go ahead, be obsessed, enjoy the obsession, count all you like, but don’t let it get you in trouble and remember, popcorn is best when mico-waved for 4 minutes and 17 seconds, people are more likely to answer the door if you knock 7 times and a tea leaf sieve will come really clean if it is tapped 7 times.</p>
