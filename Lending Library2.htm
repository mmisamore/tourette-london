The Boy Who Couldn’t Stop Washing: The Experience & Treatment of Obses

by Judith L. Rapoport, M.D.

Published in 1989

260

E.P. Dutton, New York

 

Suitable for adults, reading level about grade 9

 

In The Boy Who Couldn't Stop Washing, Judith Rapoport describes several patient stories and how their lives are affected from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).  In this description, Rapoport includes Charles's story "The  Boy Who Couldn't Stop  Washing".  These stories illustrate how OCD permeates the individual's life and alters their functioning at home, school and work and the negative impact on the family.  Most importantly, Rapoport describes her patients with a sense of curiosity mixed with compassion and understanding.

 

Rapoport writes further about the doctor's perspective about OCD, interspersing medical information about OCD as a biochemical disorder, medications and treatments for OCD, AIDS as an obsession, trichotillomania (hair-pulling), and scrupulosity (religious obsessions).  What is fascinating is the section on grooming and nesting behaviors in animals, which are highly ritualized behaviors similar to hoarding behaviors in humans.  In the last section of the book, Rapoport includes a checklist for Obsessions and Compulsions , a description of Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder, information about behavior  therapy and Anafranil (clomipramine), and the religious perspective on OCD.

 

A suggested reference list is included for further reading.  Despite this book was written thirteen years ago, it is informative and accurately describes the complexity of Obsessive-Compulsive disorder.  It would be much more informative if there were a current edition that included the criteria for OCD from the DSM-IV (1994), research  about OCD (strep link), information about newer medications (Celexa, etc.), and recent references and resources.

Children with Tourette Syndrome: A Parents’ Guide

by: Tracy Haerle

Published in 1992

Paperback, 340

Monarch Books of Canada

 

"Children With Tourette Syndrome" is a comprehensive book that covers a broad range of TS issues.  Author Tracy Haerle had pulled together both parents and professionals to author the various chapters of the book.  Topics include an overview of TS, medical treatments, adjusting to daily life, children with TS and their families, child development, education needs and legal rights.

 

The chapters on daily life by Marilynn Kaplan, children and their families by Dr.Carl Hansen and education by Larry Burd are particularly helpful.  Ms. Kaplan takes behaviour management and applies it to TS children.  Cues and redirection become valuable tools for the TS child both at home and at school.  Dr. Hansen stresses the importance of striving for as normal a family life as possible.  It is all too common for families to be consumed by TS and for the family unit to revolve around the TS child while potentially neglecting the needs of other siblings.  The education needs of children with TS range from being no different from any other child to requiring a full IEP (individual education plan).  Mr. Burd discusses the social and academic problems that might arise for TS kids such as difficulties with peers, phobias, handwriting, homework, parent-school relationships and how they all contribute to finding the right program for your child.

 

In the chapter on medications and professionals, Dr. Orrin Palmer discusses the various medical treatments commonly used for tics, CD and ADHD including "normal" doses, side effects and effectiveness.  This particular section is somewhat outdated as there is no mention of more recent medications such as risperidone.  He also discusses the various professionals that families may deal with.  The section on dentists was useful as it is an area that may be forgotten until the TS child tics in the dentist chair!

 

The least applicable section of the book is the chapter on legal rights simply because the chapter is written based on US laws and rights.  This having been said, similar legislation does exist in Canada for persons with disabilities (federal jurisdiction) and special needs education (provincial jurisdiction).

 

Anyone who has read "Children With Tourette Syndrome" will agree that it is an excellent starting point for all families and young adults.  The poignant parent statements at the end of each chapter share feelings and experiences that many of us have encountered, particularly new parents.  They serve to reinforce the statement on the cover of the book itself that this is, "the first book that families should read."

A Cursing Brain:  The Histories Of Tourette Syndrome

by Howard I Kushner

Published in 1999

Hardcover, 320

Harvard University Press

 

A Cursing Brain, by Howard Kushner, chronicles the history of Tourette Syndrome (TS) from the days of Gilles de la Tourette to the present.  The book begins by examining the early work undertaken by Jean-Martin Charcot and his intern, de la Tourette, at the Salp6tri6re Hospital in France as they looked at "les maladies des tics".  While this particular section of the book is interesting, some will find it rather dry reading.  The book quickly grabs the reader's attention however, when Kushner moves into the 1950's and the struggle between those advocating a psychoanalytical origin and those who believed the disorder was organic in nature unfolds.  Mothers everywhere will shudder when they read how proponents of psychoanalysis were quick to assign blame to them or to repressed childhood sexual conflict as a basis for tics.

 

Kushner details the ongoing reluctance of the psychiatric community to accept that the ability of drugs such as haloperidol to treat TS strongly indicated that there was an organic basis to the disorder.  What becomes readily apparent in the book is the relatively short time that TS has been accepted as being a neurological disorder, despite indications as early as 1896 that there could be an environmental trigger such as the streptococcal bacteria.  In fact, the conflict between the French and American medical communities, as to the nature of TS, continued into the early 1990's.  A Cursing Brain is well worth the read for the individual who is interested in the history TS.  It not only depicts how far we have come but how far we still have to go before we completely understand the nature of TS.

Dysinhibition Syndrome: How to Handle Anger and Rage in your Child or Spouse

by Rose Wood

Published 1999

271

Hope Press

 

Many individuals with primary neurological disorders exhibit behaviours, such as excessive silliness, sassiness, inappropriate outbursts or rage and defiance, that appear to stem from his or her inability to control or inhibit certain words or actions.  This lack of inhibition transcends many disorders and is thought to result from the person's inability to use the inhibitory process.  Rose Wood has drawn on her experience as a mother, dedicated volunteer and social worker to categorize such behaviours into a disorder which she calls "dysinhibition syndrome" (DS).  Her thesis is presented in the book Dysinhibition Syndrome: How to Handle Anger and Rage in Your Child or Spouse.

 

Wood presents 22 criteria that she has characterised as defining the syndrome along with a list of neurological and psychiatric disorders and behaviours commonly seen with DS.  The book challenges the reader to re-examine many behaviours that are traditionally associated with a spectrum of disorders that includes TS, OCD,ADD/ADHD, autism and conduct disorders, and consider them as a separate syndrome in their own right.  To support her thesis, Wood presents the argument that individuals suffering from Alzheimer's Disease or closed-head brain injury frequently exhibit dysinhibited behaviour.  While she does not indicate how many of the criteria must be present to confer a diagnosis of DS, she does state that an individual must meet the first criteria - documentation of a primary neurological disorder.

 

Strategies and treatment options for managing dysinhibited behaviours and a discussion of the problems that can result when trying to implement them are also outlined in the book.  In addition, Wood put a personal perspective on dysinhibition in a section that chronicles her experiences with her own family.

 

Dysinhibition Syndrome is a book that puts forth a new perspective on how to define unpredictable and uncontrollable behaviour.  As such, the reader may find the need to read the book more than once to fully comprehend its content.  While summaries at the end of each chapter are effective in capturing the key points of each section, the reader may find it helpful to read the synopsis prior to reading the chapter.  Whether one agrees with her premise or not, Rose Wood does present a compelling case for "dysinhibition syndrome".

The Explosive Child

by Ross W. Greene, Ph.D.

Published in 1998

342

Harper Collins

 

Those of us who heard Ross Greene speak at the national conference in Ottawa in June were captivated by his experiences of dealing with children that he calls “inflexible-explosive”.  Greene believes that “children will do well if they can, not if they want to”.  After all, why wouldn’t a child want to do well?  Many parents with difficult children feel they have failed when their child does not respond to the traditional parenting methods of praise and consequences, of “catching Johnny doing something right”.  In his book, The Explosive Child, Greene states that inflexible-explosive children can’t respond because they don’t know how.  He presents a new approach for dealing with these  children and offers strategies that will assist the child in learning how to reduce his or her levels of frustration.

 

Greene uses numerous examples that he calls “drama in real life” to illustrate his approach.  He begins by stressing that all other factors must be addressed before parents can deal with their child’s inflexible-explosive behaviour.  In other words, determine what else could be causing or contributing to the behaviour (TS, ADD/HD, OCD, LD, anxiety and so on) and deal with it first.  The “pathways” to inflexibility-explosiveness are explored and Greene emphasizes the first step is to provide a “user-friendly” environment for the child.  The child then needs to be given a toolbox full of strategies to help him or her cope.  He moves on to outline his basket theory, a simple but highly effective way to categorise behaviours that induce “meltdowns”.  The aim of “basketizing” is to classify behaviours as those worth inducing a rage (safety), those that can be compromised in order to avoid a rage (parental authority must remain but the how is flexible) and those that really don’t matter and therefore are forgotten.

 

Greene aims for a balanced approach. He takes care to point out that his approach may not work by itself and that ultimately, the family is the key to helping inflexible-explosive children.  The Explosive Child is an enjoyable book that is written in simple, non-clinical jargon.  It is well worth the read.

Hi, I’m Adam  A Child's Story of Tourefte Syndrome

by Adam Buehrens

Published 1991

Paperback, 35

Hope Press

 

"Hi, I'm Adam" is Adam Buehren's story of how he sees his Tourette Syndrome.  This short book chronicles his experiences from age five until he was diagnosed with TS in Grade Four.  At the time of writing, Adam was 10 years old.  The book is intended for children and adults alike.  It helps adults understand TS from a child's perspective starting with the initial question of, "What is wrong?" through the years of searching for an answer, to the relief of finally having a diagnosis.  For children, it expresses the frustrations they all face, be it trouble at school or for some, an endless parade of doctors.  My son with TS, who is nine, had no trouble relating to Adam and his story.

 

Adam's book is a "must have" resource to anyone involved in "in service" training, school libraries and resource centres.  It is very helpful in trying to explain TS to young children, particularly classmates.  The book is well written with hilarious illustrations accompanying the text.  It is easy for any school-aged child to understand and most children in Grade 2 or higher should have no difficulty reading and understanding the book.  Children can also colour the pictures and write their own stories along side Adam's.

 

"Hi, I'm Adam" lets any child know that it's okay to have TS and its okay to let others know.

Living with Tourette's Syndrome

by Elaine F. Shimberg

Published in 1995

Paperback, 256

Simon & Schuster Trade

 

Elaine Fantle Shimberg has worked closely with an advisory panel, many of whom are members of the Tourette Syndrome Association, and the TSA staff to produce "Living With Tourette Syndrome".  The back cover heralds that this book, "does much to dispel the myths about Tourette's and provides sensible advice, comfort and hope for anyone affected by the disorder".

 

The book is divided into five sections the majority of which are similar in content to most other general books on TS.  The author covers topics such as dealing with a diagnosis of TS, medication, stress and family reactions.  Recognizing that TS does not end with the onset of adulthood however, Shimberg has very appropriately chosen to end her book with a substantial section on adult issues - an area that often gets overlooked in TS literature and at conferences.

 

Seven chapters are devoted to topics ranging from dating and social interaction to workplace issues such as employment rights and interviewing for a job.  Many of us with children with TS tend to forget that they will be adults far longer than they were ever children.  The struggle to cope with a childhood obsession or compulsion, as an example, takes on a whole new meaning when faced with securing and holding onto employment.  Shimberg chronicles the experiences of adults and how they are coping with their TS.  Her "real-life" stories from individuals makes "Living With Tourette Syndrome" one of the few books published that provides a frank and practical discussion of the trials of the adult with TS.

 

Shimberg concludes with a chapter on success stories in which she profiles nine individuals from varying walks of life (many of whom the reader will recognize) who have faced their TS with bravado and a willingness to confront the issues rather than avoid them.

 

All in all, this book is a well written, comprehensive look at all aspects of TS.

A Mind of Its Own: Tourette's Syndrome, a Story & a Guide

by: Ruth D. Bruun, Bertel Brunn

Published in 1994

Hardcover, 192

Oxford University Press

 

This book is intended for the general public and all medical professionals such as psychologists, social workers and teachers.  It provides a good introduction to the broad range of symptoms and discusses the usual presentation and the typical responses that a person who developed Tourette Syndrome evokes form their environment.  The first part of each chapter describes what life is like for a person with Topurette Syndrome (the “Story”) and the second part discusses the issues more systematically (the “Guide”)

 

The directions with the school and with the medical facilities described, highlight that frequently it is the family that has to push for the correct diagnosis.  The authors have been able to show the broad range of severity of the disorder, the variations over time and the differences among different individuals.

 

Bruun and Bruun have a great deal of experience with the subject and they also show a lot of warmth and compassion.  This book is well written, easy to read, and it provides a wealth of up-to-date information.  This publication will be of great interest to all who are involved with Tourette Syndrome.

Music in the Midst of Chaos

by Jean Conklin Published

Carico Press

 

In "Music In The Midst of Chaos" Jean Conklin shares with the reader her own experiences of raising not just one challenged daughter but two.  In this very heart warming narrative, Mrs. Conklin writes about the challenges that she, her husband and her two daughters face as the girls learn to live with and successfully manage the effects of Tourette Syndrome(TS) and Cerebral Palsy (CP) in their lives.

 

On one hand this is one woman's story of dealing with a child with CP and another developmentally delayed child, Trista, who happens to have TS.  On the other hand, this story offers universal insights into experiences that are shared by many parents of exceptional children.  From Trista's difficulty in diagnosis, in school and her parents' disappointment with the medication that is prescribed to her, to issues surrounding vocational training, this book offers wonderful insights into issues that effect many of our readers.  You'll identify with many feelings expressed by Mrs. Conklin especially with the frustrations of dealing with both the school system and certain teachers when advocating for the rights of her children.  Mrs. Conklin offers much helpful advice both in the form of text and helpful lists.  Of particular interest are Mrs. Conklin's versions of the Parents' Declaration of Independence and Bill of Rights (107) and (her own) Jean's Rules for School Meetings (58).  Many of these "rules" deal with building a "personal library" of resources from which the teacher may borrow.  Many such helpful resources can be obtained from the Tourefte Syndrome Foundation of Canada, most notably, The Handbook for Educators.  Other helpful hints range from building a personal advocacy file to even what to wear when meeting the teacher.  Advocacy is the main theme of this publication and many American bills are named, however, the thoughts, feelings and advice delivered by Mrs. Conklin transcend the boundaries of the two countries.

 

Mrs. Conklin's book has many other good features such as the very comprehensive appendices, which includes lists of famous people with TS as well as myths about TS but, perhaps, one of the most unique aspects of this book is the chapter devoted to siblings.  This chapter includes a number of stories written by the siblings of children with challenges, including TS.  Tia, (Trista's sister) contributes a story of which many of our readers will identify with.

 

Overall, "Music in the Midst of Chaos" is a worthwhile read for the entire family.  Both parents and elder siblings alike will e able to reap valuable information from its.

OCD Workbook: Your Guide to Braking Free from

by Bruce Ml Hyman, Ph.D. & Cherry Pedrick, R.N.

Published 1999

217

New Harbinger Publications

 

Individuals and families needing a companion guide to help with the daily struggle of combating their obsessive-compulsive behaviours need wait no longer.  Bruce Hyman and Cheryl Pedrick have joined forces to produce a well written, well organized book that is aimed at helping individuals break free of their obsessive-compulsive behaviours.

 

The OCD Workbook presents a self-directed programme based on cognitive-behaviour therapy that is simple to follow.  The authors lead the reader through clear explanations of the nature and types of OCD - hoarders, checkers, cleaners, orderers, etc - and the various medications used to treat OCD.  Building on this knowledge, the reader is then given the opportunity to classify his or her obsessions and compulsions and rate the severity of anxiety associated with not performing the obsession or compulsion.  Hyman and Pedrick make this task easy through the use of extensive checklists and prompts that the user can fill in as he/she proceeds.

 

Throughout the book, the authors stress the need to have family support involved in helping the individual combat OCD.  The book includes sections on how to recognize OCD in children and also how families can inadvertently reinforce OCD symptoms by helping too much.  The authors stress that the book is intended as a guide and should not be used as a substitute for proper medical care.  It is however, an excellent tool that can be used in conjunction with other methods to assist those with OCD in identifying, targeting and reducing their obsessions and compulsions.

Passing for Normal: A Memoir of Compulsion

by: Amy Wilensky

Published in 1999

Hardcover, 256

Broadway Books

 

Passing for Normal, by Amy Wilensky, is an autobiographical account of her life coping with Tourette Syndrome and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.  Wilensky doesn't dwell on the minute details of her life.  Instead she presents an honest and frank account of how she has tried to "pass for normal" throughout her life.  What began as a simple neck twitch in a seven year old girl progressed into full blown TS and OCD complete with an obsession with even numbers, especially the number six.

 

Wilensky chronicles her TS from her days in ballet school, through prep school and into university.  Ironically in a world of prep school teen-age angst, her TS made her popular.  Rather than being ridiculed for her odd behaviour, Wilensky was viewed as a rebel by her peers - someone who dared to be different.  All the while she struggled internally with her ever growing tics and obsessive-compulsive behaviours, trying to pass for normal yet feeling like a fraud.

 

Numerous books have been written and reviewed in this newsletter but Passing for Normal is one of the first to be penned that chronicles a personal account of coping with TS.  For this reason, it is a must read, particularly for families and individuals struggling to cope with a diagnosis of TS.

Quit it

by Marcia Byalick

Published in 2002

Hardcover, 171

Delacorte Press

 

“Quit It” is a fictional story of a 12 year old girl’s first year dealing with TS.  Carrie goes through a 3 month period of visiting doctors to finally come up with a “french” word for what’s wrong with her.  School starts in a couple of weeks and Carrie is worried about how she will deal with school and Tourette syndrome.

 

The story describes many of the problems school age children have dealing with their peers and teachers and provides insight into Carrie’s feelings as she copes - day by day.  Remarkably, Carrie’s parents, while understanding the diagnosis of TS, don’t know how to interact with Carrie.

 

Breakthroughs are made with peers and staff at her school and most importantly, with her mother and father and her older sister.  The story ends with Carrie continuing to deal with symptoms that affect her “quality of life” but with those around her understanding more about what she is going through.  This makes Carrie’s life infinitely better.

 

All possible symptoms of TS are never contained within one person.  This book is a very plausible story of one case of Tourette syndrome and contains no inaccuracies.  Provided you accept that your child may have TS and exhibit none of Carrie’s symptoms, I recommend this book as well worth reading.

Ritalin Nation: Rapid Fire Culture and the Transformation of Human Conscio

Richard DeGrandpre, Ph.D.

Published 1999

284

W.W. Norton & Company

 

In the past decade, the rise in the number of North American children and adults diagnosed of Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) with or without the Hyperactivity component (ADHD) has been exponential.  Not surprisingly, the number of individuals taking ritalin the "drug of choice" to treat ADD/ADHD, has also increased equally rapidly.  In his book Ritalin Nation, Richard De Grandpre examines this phenomenon, one which he attributes to a generation in need of "constant sensory consumption" and the "speed of the American culture."

 

DeGrandpre's premise is that while no one doubts that a small percentage of children are born with ADD/ADHD, we have largely created the disorder through our ever increasingly fast pace of life.  In other words, ADD/ADHD is more a cultural phenomenon than a biological one.  He quotes an eighth grade teacher, "The reason our children don't follow directions is that they're tuned out.  They have so much stimulation....I'm not sure so many have ADHD: they're just restless because...they're so used to being entertained."

 

The author examines how society has progressed from being rural based, where time was dictated by the seasons to one that is constantly focused on how we can "save time" and cram more into each day.  Ritalin Nation poses questions that challenge the reader to examine how we live our daily lives.  Does our need as adults to speed through life manifest itself in our children as ADHD?  Are the DSM symptoms of ADD really sensory addictions?  The arguments DeGrandpre presents in his book are certainly controversial.  In this reviewer's community, there are several professionals who subscribe to his premise while others would disagree and would consider the biological basis of ADD/ADHD as being sound.

 

The reader may not agree with what DeGrandpre has to say in Ritalin Nation but the arguments are compelling.  While the book is written from an American perspective, it does mirror many elements of Canadian society and is well worth the read.

Taking Tourette Syndrome to School

by Tira Krueger

Published

JayJo Books

 

One of the more recent children's books on Tourette Syndrome,"Taking Tourette Syndrome to School" is published by JayJo books, a publisher for and about special needs children.  This book is a wonderful story for both the newly diagnosed child and those currently living with TS.

 

Megan (the "main character") takes the reader through an average school day as she shares with us information about the characteristics of TS, the medication and how it feels to have TS.  Megan also talks about how her motor and vocal tics affect her at school.  This children's book is well illustrated and has very child-friendly language.  The author takes many difficult concepts and easily breaks them down by using simplified language and terms.

 

This book could be read to classmates by a child or by a teacher to their class.  It is one in a series of books written about various exceptionalities.

Teaching the Tiger

by Marilyn P Dornbush, Ph.D. & Sheryl K. Pruitt, M.Ed.

Published in 1995

Paperback, 200

Hope Press

 

This book is an absolute must for every school in Canada!  The section on definitions of specific conditions such as ADD or ADHD, the predominantly hyperactive type versus the predominately inattentive or the combined type, or TS alone or combined, etc. is very specific in regards to behaviours.  This would be a definite asset to teachers and parents alike.

 

For teachers the section on classroom modifications is again very specific to certain behaviours and how to help prevent problems with them.

 

There is much, much more valuable information in the rest of the book regarding academic interventions, the use of computers, individualized education programs, etc. that would make this book invaluable to anyone working with or living with a person with TS or ADHD.

 

Though my son was not diagnosed with TS until grade 11, I'm sure this book would have helped his teachers in elementary school understand him and others like him much better and with greater empathy.  I would definitely recommend this book as a wonderful education source.

Tourette Syndrome: Finding Answers and Getting Help

by Mitzi Waltz

Published in 2001

O'Reilly & Associates Inc

 

It has been six years since the last general information book on TS was published.  During this period, the understanding of TS and its associated disorders has increased tremendously.  New medications have been approved for use and the rise of the internet has given us access to an abundance of information and resources.  It was only a matter of time therefore, that a new book capturing the latest information would be written.

 

Tourette's Syndrome Finding Answers & Getting Help, authored by Mitzi Walsh. is part of a series of "Patient

Centered Guides" published by O'Reilly & Associates.  Ms Walsh has covered the basic issues facing parents and individuals with TS such as diagnosis, associated disorders, school issues and living with TS.  She includes a chapter on medical care, which reviews the progress of TS treatment and discusses the latest treatment options, including a section on PANDAS (pediatric auto-immune neurological disorders associated with strep).

 

In addition                                   to information on traditional interventions, Ms Walsh presents an honest, "judge for yourself" overview of a tentative interventions such as acupuncture, homeopathy, dietary supplements and behavioural therapy options.  This chapter is a valuable addition to the book as non-medical treatments are playing a greater role in how we deal with many medical conditions.

 

The greatest strength of this book however, is its international focus on school issues, healthcare and TS resources.  Typically TS books by American authors focus on U.S. issues leaving the Canadian reader wondering how this applies to him or her.  In Tourette's Syndrome Finding Answers & Getting Help, education and health care resources in Canada, the U.K., New Zealand and Australia are also covered.  For those with a thirst for knowledge, the appendices provide a wealth of current resources for further reading and information.

Tourette's Syndrome: The Facts

by: Mary Robertson, Simon Baron-Cohen

Published in 1998

Paperback, 128

Oxford University Press

 

"TOURETTE SYNDROME the facts" is a short, concise book written by Robertson and Cohen, two staff psychiatrists at the Tourette clinic at the National Hospital, Queen Square in London, England.  The book takes the format of many TS "information" texts in that it discusses common symptoms, diagnosis, coping strategies and concludes with a chapter on education.

 

This book is unique however, in the way TS is introduced to the reader.  The authors use three very different cases to demonstrate how TS varies from individual to individual both in severity and presentation.  This is an effective way to capture the reader's attention and set the stage for the chapters to follow.  One segment that is particularly well explained is how the obsessions and compulsions of individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) differ from the obsessive-compulsive behaviours that are common to many individuals with Tourette Syndrome.

 

To compensate for the short length of the book, the authors have included a comprehensive bibliography of scientific research papers and books categorized into areas such as genetics, historical aspects and famous people with TS, clinical characteristics and treatment.  The interested reader can subsequently use the references to expand his or her knowledge of Ts and its related disorders.  There is also an appendix that lists current TS contacts and associations for over 50 countries world wide.

 

As stated in the preface of the book, the authors' aim was to produce "a readable, slim text on Tourette Syndrome, summarizing what is known about the condition for a general reader." They have done just that.

Understanding Tourette Syndrome: A Handbook for Educators

by Tourette Syndrome Foundation of Canada

Published 2001

Paperback, 79

Tourette Syndrome Foundation of Canada

 

The Tourette Syndrome Foundation of Canada (TSFC) has recently published Understanding Tourette Syndrome: A Handbook for Educators.  Over three years in the making, this book is a comprehensive guide written for teachers, parents and all others who play an integral role in the education of students with TS.

 

A particularly enjoyable feature of the book is the quotes interspersed throughout the text such as the following: "The TS child, I think, feels trapped in his own mind and by his own body."  They bring a sensitivity to the handbook that allows the reader to focus on the individual with TS.

 

The handbook is divided into three sections, the first of which, "Tourette Syndrome: An Overview" provides the most current and comprehensive review of TS and its associated disorders available to date.  The section is written in clear, concise language that makes it very interesting to read.  Specific examples of tics and behaviours are listed and summary tables are provided for easy reference.  The overview is followed by a section detailing strategies that educators can use in the classroom.  Potential problem areas, such as difficulties with transition from one activity to another, organization, handwriting, the school bus and homework are all covered.  Finally, the potential participants in and the role of the interdisciplinary support team is discussed in the last section.  The student is always the centre of the team which may be composed of only the teacher, the student and the parents for a child with mild TS.  In the child with TS+, the team may also include a teaching assistant, a speech language pathologist, a psychologist, a case manager, the resource teacher, a guidance counsellor and other professionals.

 

Including appendices, the handbook is almost 100 in length.  An excellent five page "Quick Reference" guide, which may be photocopied for use at home or in the school, is provided at the end of the book.  In addition to the quick reference, the appendices provide useful checklists to use in identifying TS, OCD and ADHD behaviours observed in the classroom or at home.  Understanding Tourette Syndrome: A Handbook for Educators is an extremely interesting and highly readable book that will undoubtedly gain quick acceptance in the education community as the reference handbook of choice for all educators.

Windows into the A. D. D. Mind: Understanding & Treating Attention Deficit Dis

by: Daniel G. Amen

Published in 1995

Mindworks Press

 

"Windows Into the A.D.D. Mind:' by Dr. Daniel Amen, is a 75 minute video with an accompanying book by the same name.  While the two do complement each other, it is not necessary to view the video as well as read the book.

 

Dr. Amen is a psychiatrist whose research and practice involve the use of SPECT scans to provide a picture of the mind.  In the simplest of terms, a SPECT scan is similar to a PET scan in that a radioisotope is injected into the body and then travels to the brain where it makes it possible to view the various sections of the brain in colour.  According to Dr. Amen, the difference is that a SPECT scan is less time consuming and less expensive than a PET scan.

 

The book is divided into four parts beginning with several case studies of individuals with ADD/ADHD.  These examples paint the "ADD picture" that allows the reader to follow Dr. Amen as he moves on to define ADD and its associated subtypes.  He then uses the SPECT scans to clearly identify the differences in how the ADD mind reacts to situations such as focussing, stress and aggression.  In conjunction with the photographs, Dr. Amen discusses the related cases and how the scan assisted with the diagnosis of ADD in his patients.  The last part of the book is titled "Treatment and Living With ADD" and covers topics such as parenting skills, behaviour modifications, social skills and classroom management of the ADD child.  The information provided is consistent with other ADD related literature and there is nothing new here.  What is unique about this part however, is a chapter on "Tips for Adults".  Through the case studies and practical advice, the ADD adult is given a wide range of options for coping with daily life.

 

The accompanying video is an informative and frequently humorous seminar based on the first three parts of the book.  Dr. Amen again reviews case studies of children and adults alike accompanying each with the related SPECT scans.  Through the numerous examples presented, one gets a complete picture of the ADD mind.  A critique of the video is that the questions asked by the audience throughout the seminar cannot be heard clearly and the pictures of the SPECT scans are not as clear when seen on video.  Thus, the flow of the presentation is broken from time to time.  However, the video is still very effective.  This is primarily due to Dr. Amen's presentation and speaking style.

 

All in all, "Windows Into the A.D.D. Mind" is a thorough overview of attention deficit disorder and its associated subtypes.  After reading the book or viewing the video, the parent, individual or educator has a much greater understanding of ADD.
