         <h1>Tourette Syndrome</h1>

         <p>
            Tourette <a href="ae0034.htm">Syndrome</a> is a 
            <a href="ae0061.htm">chronic</a> neurochemical disorder that causes
            <a href="ae0011.htm">involuntary</a> 
            <a href="ae0062.htm">movements</a> and
            <a href="ae0063.htm">sounds</a> known as
            <a href="ae0004.htm">tics</a>.
         </p>

         <p>
            Tourette <a href="ae0034.htm">Syndrome</a> is also commonly known as TS.
         </p>

         <p>
            Tourette <a href="ae0034.htm">Syndrome</a> is identified as a
            <a href="ae0034.htm">syndrome</a>
            because there is no known cause of the disorder.
         </p>

         <p>
            TS is not a disease.
         </p>

         <p>
            Tourette Syndrome is considered <a href="ae0061.htm">chronic</a> because the diagnosis 
            requires the <a href="ae0004.htm">tics</a> to be present for at 
            least one year.
         </p>

         <p>
            TS is described as neurochemical because it is believed to be caused by an
            abnormal regulation of at least one brain chemical (neurotransmitter) called
            dopamine. Very likely other neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, are also
            involved.
         </p>

         <p>
            <a href="ae0004.htm">Tics</a> are considered <a href="ae0011.htm">involuntary</a> even though, 
            in some cases, they can be delayed or even prevented entirely with effort. Some 
            <a href="ae0004.htm">tics</a>, however, are performed without the person being aware of the 
            <a href="ae0004.htm">tic</a> and in other cases, even though the person is aware of the urge 
            to perform the <a href="ae0004.htm">tic</a>, it cannot be delayed or prevented. Delaying or 
            "holding in" <a href="ae0004.htm">tics</a> may result in a greater expression of the 
            <a href="ae0004.htm">tics</a> at a later time.
         </p>

         <p>
            The <a href="ae0035.htm">diagnostic criteria</a> for TS requires the presence of
            both multiple motor and one or more phonic <a href="ae0004.htm">tics</a> at some
            time, but not necessarily at the same time, lasting for a period of at least one
            year.
         </p>

         <p>
            A person displaying <a href="ae0004.htm">tics</a> or <a href="ae0062.htm">movements</a> 
            that do not meet the criteria for TS may be diagnosed with another <a href="ae0037.htm">
            Movement Disorder</a> or <a href="ae0030.htm">Tic Disorder</a>.
         </p>

         <p>
            Motor <a href="ae0004.htm">tics</a> are <a href="ae0062.htm">movements</a> 
            of parts of the body such as fingers, arms, head and shoulders caused by 
            muscle contraction.
         </p>

         <p>
            Phonic <a href="ae0004.htm">tics</a> are <a href="ae0063.htm"> sounds</a> 
            that may be vocal such as squeaks, throat clearing and words or non-vocal 
            sounds such as sniffing and coughing.
         </p>

         <p>
            People with TS share the common <a href="ae0018.htm"> symptom</a> of 
            <a href="ae0004.htm">tics</a>, however, no two people will share the exact same 
            <a href="ae0004.htm">tics</a>. <a href="ae0018.htm">Symptoms</a> of TS and 
            <a href="ae0012.htm">associated disorders</a> 
            and behaviours will look different from person to person. 
            <a href="ae0018.htm"> Symptoms</a> will vary from mild to severe and may disappear 
            completely at times.
         </p>

         <h1>Part of a Family of Disorders</h1>

         <p>
         Tourette Syndrome disorder is part of a larger spectrum of disorders known as <a
               href="ae0037.htm">Movements Disorders</a>. <a href="ae0037.htm">Movement Disorders</a> 
            include <a href="ae0002.htm">Chorea,</a> <a href="ae0006.htm"> Dystonia</a>,
            <a href="ae0008.htm">Myoclonus</a>, <a href="ae0009.htm"> Seizure Disorders</a>,
            <a href="ae0030.htm">Tic Disorders</a>, and <a href="ae0007.htm"> Tremor</a>.
         </p>

         <p>
         There is no evidence that Tourette Syndrome is linked to other than 
         <a href="ae0030.htm">Tic Disorders</a>. Most physicians 
         familiar with <a href="ae0037.htm">Movement Disorders</a> will quickly separate a 
         <a href="ae0030.htm">Tic Disorder</a> from other <a href="ae0037.htm">Movement Disorders</a>
         </p>

         <p>
         <a href="ae0030.htm">Tic Disorders</a> include subtypes: 
         <a href="ae0023.htm">Chronic Tic Disorder</a> 
         <a href="ae0005.htm">Stereotypies</a>, Tourette Syndrome, and 
         <a href="ae0017.htm">Transient Tic Disorder</a>
         </p>

         <p>
         The majority of <a href="ae0035.htm"> diagnoses</a> of Tourette
         Syndrome will be made based on the history (past behaviours) of the
         patient as reported by either the patient or in the case of children,
         by the parents of the child.  Observations of the patient during the
         visit will also be used in the <a href="ae0035.htm">diagnosis</a>.  
         </p>

         <p>
         Separating Tourette Syndrome from other <a href="ae0030.htm"> Tic Disorders</a> 
         is a matter of looking at the current diagnostic criteria of Tourette Syndrome as 
         defined by the <a href="ae0024.htm">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
            Disorders (DSM.)</a>
         </p>
      </section>

      <section>
         <h1>Associated Disorders</h1>

         <p>
            Tourette Syndrome may be present in a person as a lone condition which may be described as 
            "<a href="ae0028.htm">TS-Only</a>" or "<a href="ae0028.htm">Pure TS</a>" but is more often 
            accompanied by another diagnosable medical condition that is often referred 
            to as being a <a href="ae0019.htm"> co-morbid condition</a> or an <a href="ae0012.htm">
            associated disorder</a>. 
         </p>

         <p>
            The most common <a href="ae0012.htm">associated disorders</a> are <a href="ae0013.htm">Obsessive 
            Compulsive Disorder</a> and <a href="ae0003.htm"> Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder</a> 
            and the variations of these conditions.
         </p>

         <p>
            It is important to understand the conditions and the differences between the conditions and 
            which condition a given <a href="ae0018.htm"> symptom</a> or behaviour belongs to.
            Treatment, whether <a href="ae0026.htm"> psychological</a> or <a href="ae0027.htm">
            medical</a>, is specific to the condition.
         </p>

         <h1>Other</h1>

         <p>
            TS is believed to be <a href="ae0033.htm">genetically</a> transmitted.
